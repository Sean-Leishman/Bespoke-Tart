# Tasks Before Next Meeting
- Setup Github repository with notes
- Send email containing papers read and any comments or questions 
- Look into gaining access to cluster

# Milestones (Week 5)
- Write a good quality background chapter that can be inserted into dissertation 
	- Does not just list papers and their findings 
	- use findings from paper to justify own decisions such as their features that we are improving on, borrowing
	- Critically analyse the papers to find holes in data used, methods of evaluation
	- 
- Download dataset, setup deep learning tools, get BERT embeddings available for processing  
# General 
- Decided on using BERT encodings with purely linguistic features by using transcripts
- Okay to use code used by other authors, just have to cite
- Understand the broad range of turn-taking and the high level understanding with respect to improving conversational agents such as Siri beyond simple pause detection
- Investigate other datasets
- Investigate other baselines with word2vec
- Plan schedule well 
	- Blocks of time allocated to working on project with consideration of other courses

# Other Notes
- Task of using BERT to predict end-of-turn from sentences that are not necessarily bounded by [SEP] token
