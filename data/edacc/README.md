# EDACC Data 

## Transcripts
Can be found in `data/dev/text` or `data/test/text` and the data is already split for train, test and validation sets. There is additional information contained in their README at `data/README.text`.

Generally though, `text` consists of textual transcription, segment contains time alignment information, utt2spk contains the corresponding speaker for each segment.
