## Transcriptions
For transcriptions, the corpus is split into two main parts. `cellular` and `switchboard` which will be used as a verified portion of transcriptual data. 

A conversation is recorded and transcribed as a full conversation where each record is a turn or on word by word basis where each word is on a separate line. This is done as word alignment is performed such that the timing of each word is recorded as well as the timing of the entire utterance.
